# Shadowing outer local variables with block parameters is often useful
# to not reinvent a new name for the same thing, it highlights the relation
# between the outer variable and the parameter. The cases where it's actually
# confusing are rare, and usually bad for other reasons already, for example
# because the method is too long.
