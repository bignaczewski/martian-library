# README

This is a project based on the following tutorial https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/graphql-on-rails-1-from-zero-to-the-first-query, https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/graphql-on-rails-2-updating-the-data, https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/graphql-on-rails-3-on-the-way-to-perfection. 

It contains Ruby on Rails back-end, GrapqQL and React/Apollo front-end.

On top of the project created while following the tutorial I added rubocop, foreman and lazy preloading (to solve the N+1 db problem).
